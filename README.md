# Stock Market Machine Learning
The stock market can seem like an extremely risky and unpredictable environment in
which to place one’s hard-earned money. There are numerous factors that come into play when it
comes to a stock’s end-of-day worth, and every investment comes with some amount of risk.
Taking all the contributing factors into consideration to decide which stock to invest in can be
very overwhelming for one person, and typically one will hire a team of financial advisors to do
so for them. Machine learning, however, has developed enough to subsidize a lot of the work
involving large quantities of data, and can read through and perform analyses on it in a fraction
of the time a team of people could. For this reason, our group has chosen to utilize machine
learning to tackle the issue of accurately predicting stock market prices.
